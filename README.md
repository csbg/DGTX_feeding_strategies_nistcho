# Systematic Evaluation of Fed-Batch Feeding Strategies in NISTCHO Linking Culture Performance to Product Quality Attributes on Intact cNISTmAb

## 📄 Overview

This repository contains the analysis scripts, processed datasets, and figure-generation code for the publication.

In this study, we systematically investigate how distinct fed-batch feeding strategies modulate cellular performance
and monoclonal antibody (mAb) critical quality attributes (CQAs) in the NISTCHO cell line. NISTCHO, developed by
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is a novel open-access reference cell line designed to
standardize and accelerate biomanufacturing research. It is poised to become a benchmark system for bioprocess op-
timization studies. However, systematic modeling and quantitative analyses of key process parameters in this cell line
are still lacking. In particular, factors such as feeding frequency, nutrient composition, and co-factor supplementation
are known to influence both culture performance and mAb glycosylation, yet their specific interrelationships remain
poorly characterized
