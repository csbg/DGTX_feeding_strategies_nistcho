To unravel the heterogeneity of these proteoforms, novel approaches employing strong cation-exchange (SCX) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) hyphenated to mass spectrometry (MS) using a pH gradient of volatile salts have been developed in recent years. Here, we apply an established SCX-HPLC-MS method to characterize and compare two rituximab-based biotherapeutics, the originator MabThera® and its Indian copy product Reditux™. The study assessed molecular differences between the two drug products in terms of C-terminal lysine variants, glycosylation patterns, and other basic and acidic variants. Overall, MabThera® and Reditux™ displayed differences at the molecular level. MabThera® showed a higher degree of galactosylated and sialylated glycoforms, while Reditux™ showed increased levels of oligomannose and afucosylated glycoforms. Moreover, the two drug products showed differences in terms of basic variants such as C-terminal lysine and N-terminal truncation, present in Reditux™ but not in MabThera®. This study demonstrates the capability of this fast SCX-HPLC-MS approach to compare different drug products and simultaneously assess some of their quality attributes.},

  abstract    = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are widely applied as highly specific and efficient therapeutic agents for various medical conditions, including cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. As protein production in cellular systems inherently generates a multitude of molecular variants, manufacturing of mAbs requires stringent control in order to ensure safety and efficacy of the drugs. Moreover, monitoring of mAb variants in the course of the fermentation process may allow instant tuning of process parameters to maintain optimal cell culture conditions. Here, we describe a fast and robust workflow for the characterization of mAb variants in fermentation broth. Sample preparation is minimal in that the fermentation broth is shortly centrifuged before dilution and HPLC-MS analysis in a short 15-min gradient run. In a single analysis, N-glycosylation and truncation variants of the expressed mAb are identified at the intact protein level. Simultaneously, absolute quantification of mAb content in fermentation broth is achieved. The whole workflow features excellent robustness as well as retention time and peak area stability. Additional enzymatic removal of N-glycans enables determination of mAb glycation levels, which are subsequently considered in relative N-glycoform quantification to correct for isobaric galactosylation. Several molecular attributes of the expressed therapeutic protein may thus be continuously monitored to ensure the desired product profile. Application of the described workflow in an industrial environment may therefore substantially enhance in-process control in mAb production, as well as targeted biosimilar development.},

The heterogeneity of Fc glycans varies with species and expression system. Fc glycans influence the binding of IgG to Fc receptors and C1q, and are therefore important for IgG effector functions. Specifically, terminal sugars such as sialic acids, core fucose, bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, and mannose residues affect the binding of IgG to the FcgRIIIa receptor and thereby influence ADCC activity. By contrast, terminal galactose residues affect antibody binding to C1q and thereby modulate CDC activity. Structural studies indicate that the presence or absence of specific terminal sugars may affect hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between sugar residues and amino acid residues in the Fc fragment, which in turn may impact antibody effector functions.},

In this study we have specifically remodeled the Fc N-glycans of intact recombinant IgG 1 therapeutic monoclonal antibody (Mab) products, Rituxan and Herceptin, with a soluble recombinant rat β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (rGnTIII) produced by baculovirus-infected insect cells. N-Glycan remodeling in vitro permitted a controlled and selective transfer of a bisecting β1,4-linked GlcNAc to the core β-linked mannose of degalactosylated Mab N-glycans to yield Mabs varying in bisecting GlcNAc content from 31% to 85%. This was confirmed by analysis of N-glycans by both normal phase HPLC and MALDI-MS, the latter yielding the expected mass increase of 203.2 Da with no other oligosaccharide modifications evident. ADCC of remodeled Rituxan and Herceptin Mabs was determined using peripheral blood mononuclear cells as effectors and either CD20 + (SKW6.4 and SU-DHL-4) or Her2 + (SKBR-3) target cells, respectively. A conserved 10-fold increase in ADCC was observed for both remodeled therapeutic Mabs with high (>80%) bisecting GlcNAc content. In contrast, although the presence of a bisecting GlcNAc had minimal effect on CDC, degalactosylation of Rituxan reduced CDC by approximately half, relative to unmodified (variably galactosylated) control Mab. In summary, our data suggests that in vitro remodeling of therapeutic Mab Fc N-glycans may be utilized to control the therapeutic efficacy of Mabs in vivo and to offer a more "humanized" glycoform profile for recombinant Mab products.},

The heterogeneity of these glycostructures and the inherent variability of traditional PBMC-based in vitro ADCC assays, have made it challenging to quantitatively assess the impact of other glycostructures on ADCC activity. We applied a quantitative NK cell based assay to generate a database consisting of Fc-glycostructure and ADCC data from 54 manufacturing batches of a CHO-derived monoclonal antibody. Explorative analysis of the data indicated that, apart from afucosylation, galactosylation levels could influence ADCC activity. We confirmed this hypothesis by demonstrating enhanced ADCC upon enzymatic hypergalactosylation of four different monoclonal antibodies derived using standard CHO manufacturing processes. Furthermore we quantitatively compare the effects of galactosylation and afucosylation in the context of glycan heterogeneity and demonstrate that while galactose can influence ADCC activity, afucosylation remains the primary driver of this activity.},

Using design of experiments-response surface modelling (DoE-RSM) methodology to adjust the relative media concentrations of known metabolic effectors of galactosylation (manganese, galactose, and uridine) we have shown that b1,4-galactosylation of the same recombinant IgG 4 monoclonal antibody produced by different CHO cell lines can be precisely controlled in a cell line specific manner. For two cell lines, monoclonal antibody galactosylation could be increased by over 100% compared to control, non-supplemented cultures without a reduction in product titre and with minimal effect on cell growth. Analysis of galactosylation effector interactions by DoE-RSM indicated that Mn 2þ alone was necessary but not sufficient to improve galactosylation, and that synergistic combinations of Gal and Urd were necessary to maximize galactosylation, whilst minimizing the deleterious effect of Urd on cell growth. To facilitate rapid cell culture process development we also tested the hypothesis that substrate-level control of cellular galactosylation would similarly affect both cell surface and secreted monoclonal antibody glycans, enabling facile indirect prediction of product glycan processing. To support this hypothesis, comparative quantitation of CHO cell surface b1,4-galactosylation by flow cytometry using fluorescent derivatives of RCA and ConA lectins revealed that substratecontrolled variation in monoclonal antibody galactosylation and cell surface galactosylation were significantly correlated. Taken together, these data show that precision control of a complex, dynamic cellular process essential for the definition of protein product molecular heterogeneity and bioactivity is possible. Moreover, real-time, or near real-time control can be enabled by facile, rapid measurement of cell surface biomarkers of cellular biosynthetic capability.},

  abstract       = {Alternate sugars such as galactose and fructose are metabolized at a slower rate than glucose and result in lower accumulation of lactate. While low lactate accumulation is desirable, we report that complete substitution of glucose with these sugars results in an increase in M5 high mannose glycans. Surprisingly, this increase is much higher when the culture is supplemented with manganese: for example, when cells are cultured with galactose, M5 high mannose glycan content increased from 5% at 1 nM Mn 21 in the basal medium to 32% with 16 mM Mn 21 supplementation. When galactose is supplemented with glucose maintained at low concentrations, a small reduction in high mannose glycans is seen. In control cultures with glucose, the high mannose content was however <2% in this range of Mn 21 concentration. By varying Mn 21 and glucose supplementation levels, with or without galactose, we systematically demonstrate that Mn 21 concentration and glucose availability, together, significantly affect the high mannose glycan content. To our knowledge, this is the first report that shows that the effect of Mn 21 on high mannose glycan content depends on glucose availability. At each Mn 21 supplementation level evaluated, galactosylation percentages were highest for cultures where galactose was supplemented with glucose at non-limiting concentration.},

  abstract       = {N-linked glycan distribution affects important end-use characteristics such as the bioactivity and efficacy of many therapeutic proteins, (including monoclonal antibodies), in vivo. Yet, obtaining desired glycan distributions consistently during batch-to-batch production can be challenging for biopharmaceutical manufacturers. While an appropriately implemented on-line glycosylation control strategy during production can help to ensure a consistent glycan distribution, to date no such strategies have been reported. Our goal is to develop and validate a comprehensive strategy for effective on-line control of glycosylation, the successful achievement of which requires first identifying appropriate manipulated variables that can be used to direct the glycan distribution to a desired state. While various culture conditions such as bioreactor process variables, media type, and media supplements have been shown to affect the glycan distribution, in this study we focus on the latter. Specifically, we implemented a statistically designed series of experiments to determine the significant main effects (as well as interaction effects) of media supplementation with manganese, galactose, ammonia and found that each had significant effects on certain glycans. We also include data indicating the glycosylation enzyme gene transcript levels as well as the intracellular nucleotide sugar concentrations in the presence of the media supplements to provide insight into the intracellular conditions that may be contributing to the changes in glycan distribution. The acquired experimental data sets were then used to identify which glycans can be controlled by the media supplements and to what degree. We determined that MnCl 2 can be used as a manipulated variable to increase the relative abundance of M51 and decrease FA2 simultaneously, and galactose can be used as a manipulated variable to increase the relative abundance of FA2G1 and decrease FA2 and A2 simultaneously.},

  abstract       = {The glycosylation pattern of a chimeric heavy chain antibody (EG2) produced from CHO cells was affected by the glucose concentration (0-25 mM) of cultures established at high density (>10 6 ml-1) over 24 h. The resulting proportion of non-glycosylated Mab was directly correlated to the exposure time of cells to media depleted of glucose. Deprivation of glucose for the full 24 h resulted in a 45% non-glycosylated Mab fraction. Analysis of steady state levels of intracellular lipid-linked oligosaccharides (LLOs) showed that under glucose limitation there was a reduction in the amount of full length LLO (Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNac 2), with a concomitant increase in the smaller mannosyl-glycans (Man 2-5 GlcNAc 2). Glycan microheterogeneity was quantified by galactosylation and sialylation indices (GI and SI) which showed a direct correlation to the cell specific glucose uptake. The GI increased to 0.83 following media supplementation with a cocktail of uridine, manganese and galactose. This is significantly higher than for a fully humanized antibody (DP12) produced under the similar conditions or for similar antibodies reported in the literature. The high GI of the chimeric antibody (EG2) may be due to its low molecular weight and unusual structure. These findings are important in relation to the low substrate that may occur in fed-batch cultures for Mab production.},

  abstract       = {Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are mainly produced by heterologous expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The glycosylation profile of the mAbs has major impact on the efficacy and safety of the drug and is therefore an important parameter to control during production. In this study, the effect on IgG N-glycosylation from feeding CHO cells with eight glycosylation precursors during cultivation was investigated. The study was conducted in fed-batch mode in bioreactors with biological replicates to obtain highly controlled and comparable conditions. We assessed charge heterogeneity and glycosylation patterns of IgG. None of the eight feed additives caused statistically significant changes to cell growth or IgG productivity, compared to controls. However, the addition of 20 mM galactose did result in a reproducible increase of galactosylated IgG from 14% to 25%. On the other hand, addition of 20 mM N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) reduced relative abundance of galactosylated IgG by 4%. Additionally, supplementation with 10 mM mannose slightly reduced GlcNAc occupancy of IgG. Overall, comparing the effects of IgG glycosylation, by supplementing the cell culture medium with glycosylation precursors during cultivation, revealed an application of these glycosylation precursors for modulating N-glycosylation of IgG.},
